# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Imbalanced_Data_Algos
This repo will be used for practicing imbalanced data treatment, such as oversampling, undersampling, cost-sensitive learning, custom class weights, etc.

The dataset I will be using for the model is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
